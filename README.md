# Calculator
To build a simple calculator using JavaScript, we need to handle basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. JavaScript, along with HTML and CSS, is commonly used to create interactive web-based calculators.

What We Are Going to Create
We will build a simple and functional calculator that will feature

A clean and responsive design.
Buttons for each number and operation.
A display area that shows the current input and result.
A button to clear the screen.
